    <p id="crawl">So, first i said "I wanna splash some stars on the screen", so I used JS to draw 800 randomly positioned 
    divs. Then I made a couple of them twinkle, and added some light around another bunch of them. Great, I have stars, so what's next...?
    <br><br>Nebula! A couple of clouds, random size, placement and colors going from blueviolet to white. Utterly beautiful!
    At this point I thought "What now?" ...and suddenly it struck me
    <br><br>No one has ever tried something so bold, so outstanding and such a huge ripoff from Star Wars.
    Nevertheless, I'd like to see Lucasfilm work with only Javascript and CSS. Well there you have it. From
    the greatest intro a movie has ever seen, to the corniest web page one can do in a couple of hours!!
